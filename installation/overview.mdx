## MCP vs Direct API

Ref offers two main integration approaches:

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

**Best for:** Claude Desktop, VS Code, and other MCP-compatible tools

**Benefits:**
- Native integration with AI tools
- Automatic context sharing
- No manual API calls required
- Seamless user experience

**Tools available:**
- `ref_search_documentation` - Search through indexed docs
- `ref_read_url` - Extract content from any URL

### Direct API

**Best for:** Custom applications, web apps, and non-MCP tools

**Benefits:**
- Full control over requests and responses
- Works with any programming language
- Custom authentication and rate limiting
- Detailed error handling

**Endpoints available:**
- `POST /api/search` - Documentation search
- `POST /api/read-url` - URL content extraction
- `POST /api/web-search` - Real-time web search

## Prerequisites

Before installing Ref, you'll need:

1. **Ref Account**: Sign up at [ref.tools](https://ref.tools)
2. **API Key**: Get your API key from the dashboard
3. **Target Tool**: The AI tool or IDE you want to integrate with

<Warning>
Keep your API key secure. Never commit it to version control or share it publicly.
</Warning>

## Quick Setup Guide

### 1. Create Your Account

Visit [ref.tools](https://ref.tools) and create your free account. You'll get 200 credits to start.

### 2. Get Your API Key

1. Log into your dashboard
2. Navigate to "API Keys" 
3. Copy your default API key
4. Store it securely (you'll need it for configuration)

### 3. Choose Installation Method

Select the appropriate installation guide based on your tool:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="For Claude Desktop Users">
    Follow our [Claude installation guide](/installation/claude) to set up the MCP server configuration.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="For Cursor Users">
    Use our [Cursor installation guide](/installation/cursor) for one-click setup with deeplinks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="For VS Code Users">
    Check our [VS Code guide](/installation/vscode) to configure the MCP extension.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="For Custom Integrations">
    See our [API documentation](/installation/api) for direct REST API integration.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables

Many integrations support environment variable configuration:

```bash
# Set your API key
export REF_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Optional: Set custom API endpoint
export REF_API_ENDPOINT="https://ref.tools/api"

# Optional: Set request timeout
export REF_TIMEOUT="30000"
```

### Configuration Files

Some tools use configuration files for Ref settings:

```json
{
  "ref": {
    "apiKey": "your-api-key-here",
    "endpoint": "https://ref.tools/api",
    "timeout": 30000,
    "enableCache": true
  }
}
```

## Testing Your Installation

After installation, test your Ref integration:

### MCP Tools Test

If using MCP integration, try these commands:

```
ref_search_documentation("React hooks tutorial")
```

```
ref_read_url("https://react.dev/reference/react/useState")
```

### API Test

If using direct API integration:

```bash
curl -X POST https://ref.tools/api/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "React hooks tutorial"}'
```

## Troubleshooting
