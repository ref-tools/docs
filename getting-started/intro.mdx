Ref is a documentation search model MCP server that allows coding agents to search public and private docs.

Imagine your coding agent never made mistakes working with libraries (either public or private) and did it without blowing up the context window. The agent can always go find the exact snippet of documentation it needs to be successful. That's what Ref is built to do.
