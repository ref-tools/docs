## Create Your Account

1. Sign up at the Ref dashboard.
2. Copy the default API key.
3. Keep the key in a secure secret manager.

## Install the HTTP MCP Server

```json
{
  "Ref": {
    "type": "http",
    "url": "https://api.ref.tools/mcp?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY"
  }
}
```

- Works with Cursor, Claude Code, and any HTTP aware MCP client.
- Swap `YOUR_API_KEY` for the value from the dashboard.

## Legacy stdio Option

```json
{
  "Ref": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["ref-tools-mcp@latest"],
    "env": {
      "REF_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"
    }
  }
}
```

- Stick to the HTTP mode unless you must pin stdio.
- Most users only install one mode.

## Verify the Tooling

- Ask your agent: `TypeScript Node.js MCP general request failed error, search the docs with ref`.
- Confirm the client makes a `search_documentation` tool call.
- Review the returned context window before proceeding.

## Track Usage Early

- Watch the usage card in the dashboard after the first run.
- Inspect credit deltas per endpoint to catch misconfigurations.
