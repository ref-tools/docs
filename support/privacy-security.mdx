Please submit potential vulnerabilities or any security-related questions to security@ref.tools.

_While many teams and individuals already trusting Ref, please note that we are still in the journey of growing our product and improving our security posture. If you're working in a highly sensitive environment, you should be careful when using Ref (or any other AI tool). We hope this page gives insight into our progress and helps you make a proper risk assessment._

## Overview

Ref is built with security and privacy as core principles. This page outlines our security architecture, data handling practices, and compliance efforts. Key areas include:

- **MCP Implementation**: Local and remote server protocols with API key authentication
- **Data Protection**: End-to-end encryption, isolated multi-tenant architecture, and comprehensive audit logging
- **Compliance**: Active SOC2/ISO27001 certification process with subprocessor disclosure
- **Monitoring**: Real-time health checks and public status updates



## MCP

### Protocols

Ref provides an [open-source](https://github.com/ref-tools/ref-tools-mcp) `stdio` server that can be run locally and a `streamable-http` that is connected to remotely. 

### Authentication

Ref uses API keys for authentication. MCP supports OAuth however the spec has been influx and there is a [recent report](https://www.obsidiansecurity.com/blog/from-well-known-to-well-pwned-common-vulnerabilities-in-ai-agents#CyberSecurity) of sever vulnerabilities due to client implementations. The complexity of a system is itself a risk factor so we've chosen to stick to the simple API key pattern for now.

## Data Handling

### Encryption
- **In Transit**: All data is encrypted during transit. Ref uses MCP streamable-http transport.
- **At Rest**: Documents and search indices are encrypted at rest in our database.
- **Customer Managed Keys**: Turbopuffer supports customer managed encryption keys (available upon request).

### Data Isolation
We take data isolation very seriously in our multi-tenant environment:
- Each team and user has their own isolated namespace in Turbopuffer.
- Indexing jobs run in single, transient, isolated containers. Your documents and credentials are never present at the same time as another team's data.
- All application data reads go through Firestore rules that enforce user access at the database level.

### Audit Logging
- Complete activity logging for users and teams available at [ref.tools/activity](https://ref.tools/activity)
- Logs include user identity, tool calls, and arguments

### Incident Response
- Internal monitoring via Sentry and Google Cloud alerting tools
- Status updates published at [ref.tools/status](https://ref.tools/status) during incidents

## Compliance

### Certifications
- **SOC2 and ISO27001**: Currently in progress with vendor support
- Updates will be provided as certifications are completed

### Subprocessors & Data Access
Our security model includes the following subprocessors with specific data access patterns:

- **[Turbopuffer](https://turbopuffer.com)**: `Stores docs` Turbopuffer is the primary search store used by Ref. It is also used by Cursor and Notion. Stores documents, descriptions, and vector embeddings with encryption at rest and isolated namespaces. 
- **[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)**: `Sees and stores docs` Temporarily processes search results through Functions and temporarily caches results in Firestore with database-level access controls. All data is encrypted at rest.
- **[Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)**: `Sees docs` Processes indexing jobs in isolated, transient containers. User docs will be loaded 
- **[Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs)**: `Sees docs` Generates document descriptions following [Gemini API data retention policy](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/usage-policies)
- **[VoyageAI](https://www.voyageai.com/)**: `Sees docs` Creates vector embeddings of docs with zero-data retention policy  
- **[OpenAI](https://openai.com)**: `Sees docs` Powers research agent functionality with zero-data retention policy. User data will be included in prompts sent to OpenAI.
- **[Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com)**: `Sees no docs` Powers evals on public documentation sets with zero-data retention policy. User data will be included in prompts sent to OpenAI.
- **[Stripe](https://stripe.com)**: `Sees no docs` Processes payment information with PCI-compliant security standards
- **[Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com)**: `Sees no docs` Delivers transactional emails with user contact information
- **[Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com)**: `Sees no docs` Manages marketing communications and newsletter subscriptions
- **[Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com)**: `Sees no docs` Analyzes product usage analytics
- **[Sentry](https://sentry.io)**: `Sees no docs` Monitors errors and performance with anonymized telemetry data
- **[Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com)**: `Sees no docs` Used for communication and coordination.
- **[Slack](https://slack.com)**: `Sees no docs data` Used to communicate with partners
