Please submit potential vulnerabilities or any security-related questions to security@ref.tools.

_While many teams and individuals already trusting Ref, please note that we are still in the journey of growing our product and improving our security posture. If you're working in a highly sensitive environment, you should be careful when using Ref (or any other AI tool). We hope this page gives insight into our progress and helps you make a proper risk assessment._

## Overview

Ref provides enterprise-grade security with encryption in transit and at rest, role-based access controls, and strict data isolation in multi-tenant environments. We maintain zero-data retention policies with AI providers and are actively pursuing SOC2 and ISO27001 certifications.

## Data Handling

### Encryption
- **In Transit**: All data is encrypted during transit using streamable-http protocol
- **At Rest**: Documents and search indices are encrypted at rest in our database
- **Customer Managed Keys**: Turbopuffer supports customer managed encryption keys (available upon request)

### Data Isolation
We take data isolation very seriously in our multi-tenant environment:
- Each team and user has their own isolated namespace in Turbopuffer
- Indexing jobs run in single, transient, isolated containers
- Your documents and credentials are never present at the same time as another team's data
- All application data reads go through Firestore rules that enforce user access at the database level

### Audit Logging
- Complete activity logging available at `ref.tools/activity`
- Logs include user identity, tool calls, and arguments

### Incident Response
- Internal monitoring via Sentry and Google Cloud alerting tools
- Status updates published at `ref.tools/status` during incidents

## Compliance

### Certifications
- **SOC2 and ISO27001**: Currently in progress with vendor support
- Updates will be provided as certifications are completed

### Subprocessors & Data Access
Our security model includes the following subprocessors with specific data access patterns:

- **Turbopuffer**: Stores documents, descriptions, and vector embeddings with encryption at rest and isolated namespaces
- **Firebase**: Temporarily processes search results through Functions and caches in Firestore with database-level access controls
- **Google Cloud Run**: Processes indexing jobs in isolated, transient containers
- **Google Gemini**: Generates document descriptions with zero-data retention policy
- **VoyageAI**: Creates vector embeddings with zero-data retention policy  
- **OpenAI**: Powers research agent functionality with zero-data retention policy

### Monitoring & Health Checks
- Health check endpoint: `api.ref.tools/ping`
- Internal monitoring and alerting infrastructure
- Status page: `ref.tools/status` for incident communications
