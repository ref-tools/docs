## Quick Test

Let's test your Ref installation by searching for documentation:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Direct API
curl -X POST https://ref.tools/api/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "React useState hook examples"
  }'
```

```javascript MCP Tools
// In Claude Desktop or other MCP-enabled tools
ref_search_documentation("React useState hook examples")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Your First Search

Once installed, try these example searches to see Ref in action:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Search React Documentation">
    Query: "How to use React hooks with TypeScript"
    
    This will search through React's official documentation and return relevant sections about hooks and TypeScript integration.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Find API References">
    Query: "Next.js API routes middleware examples"
    
    Searches Next.js documentation for specific examples of API route middleware implementation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Read Specific URLs">
    Use `ref_read_url` to extract content from specific documentation pages or GitHub README files.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Understanding Credits
