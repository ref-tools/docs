You can find your API key at [ref.tools/keys](https://ref.tools/keys)

## Install Steps

1. Open the `mcp_config.json` file. This can be found at a path like `~/.codium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` or by opening Cascade Chat and clicking the `Customizations` icon (looks like a packing box) in the top right then clicking the settings button.

2. Update `mcp_config.json` as follows:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Ref": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["ref-tools-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "REF_API_KEY": "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Verify

Click the Cascade Chat Customizations button and see that Ref is active with 2 tools.
