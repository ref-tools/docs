## Install Steps

Gemini CLI is configured through a `settings.json` file, typically found at `~/.gemini/settings.json`.

To enable Ref, update `settings.json`:

```settings.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ref": {
      "httpUrl": "https://api.ref.tools/mcp?apiKey=<your-api-key>"
    }
  },
  ...
}%
```

## Verify

Run the command: 

```
gemini mcp list
```

You should see:

```
➜  gemini mcp list

✓ ref: https://api.ref.tools/mcp?apiKey=<your-api-key> (http) - Connected
```
