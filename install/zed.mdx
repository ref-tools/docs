[Zed MCP docs](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/mcp)

You can find your API key at [ref.tools/keys](https://ref.tools/keys)

## Install Steps

1. Open the agent thread UI in right dock with `cmd + R`.
2. In the top right, click the `...` icon and under MCP Servers, select `Add Custom Server...`. This should open the `Add MCP Server` modal.
3. In the bottom left of the modal click `Configure Remote` server.
4. Replace the entire content of the input JSON with the following and click `Add Server`.

```json
{
  "Ref": {
    "url": "https://api.ref.tools/mcp?apiKey=<your api key>"
  }
}
```

## Verify

1. Open a new thread in the agent thread panel and select the `...` settings icon then click `Settings`.
2. You should see Ref enabled in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers section.

## Using Ref in Zed

You can use the built in auto-complete prompt `/search_docs` to search documentation with Ref.

Example prompt:
```
/search_docs what is ref tools mcp server
```

This should result in a `ref_search_documentation` tool call.
