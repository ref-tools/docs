## Configure

1. Open Augment agent settings.
2. Register Ref as an HTTP MCP server.

```json
{
  "Ref": {
    "type": "http",
    "url": "https://api.ref.tools/mcp?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY"
  }
}
```

## Run Smoke Test

- Trigger an Augment playbook with a docs lookup step.
- Confirm Ref handles the request without fallback.
