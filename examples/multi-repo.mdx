title: "Multi-Repo Setup"
description: "Coordinate large codebases across teams."

## Goal

- Give agents a unified context across several GitHub repos.
- Keep search fast by scoping indexing jobs.

## Checklist

1. Connect every repo under the same team.
2. Verify each repo stays under the 2,000 file full-index threshold.
3. Tag documentation folders with clear naming for search recall.
4. Stagger large syncs to avoid simultaneous web crawls.

## Usage Pattern

- Build prompts that reference the repo slug explicitly.
- Let agents pivot across repos through a single tool call.
- Review the usage report to see which repos drive credit consumption.

## Maintenance

- Rotate API tokens that power private repo access quarterly.
- Archive superseded repos to prevent stale responses.
- Add release notes to the changelog to explain major doc shifts.
