## Overview

Ref helps AI coding assistants access your private documentation by indexing content from multiple sources. Connect GitHub repositories or upload PDFs and Markdown files to make your internal docs searchable through natural language queries.

## Available Resource Types

### GitHub Repositories
Connect your GitHub repositories to automatically index and sync documentation. Ref continuously monitors changes and keeps your docs up-to-date, making them instantly searchable for your team.

### PDF & Markdown Files
Upload documentation files directly to Ref when they're not in GitHub. PDFs are automatically converted to markdown and indexed for semantic search alongside your other resources.
