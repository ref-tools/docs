## Connect

1. Open `Resources > Repos`.
2. Authorize Ref with GitHub OAuth.
3. Pick each repository to track.

## Sync Model

- Small repos index every file.
- Repos above 2,000 files index documentation paths.
- Sync jobs run continuously and finish within 30 minutes.

## Monitoring

- The Jobs tab lists queued and running crawls.
- Recent activity surfaces searches against private content.
- Use the status column to catch auth or rate errors.

## Best Practices

- Keep repos scoped to documentation branches when possible.
- Re-run indexing after major README or API updates.
- Disable repos you no longer need to save credits.
