Manage your PDF & Markdown files at [ref.tools/resources?tab=pdf](https://ref.tools/resources?tab=pdf)

## What can you upload?

- Upload any `*.pdf` or `*.md` files. They will be automcatically chunked and indexed.
- The hard files size limit is 100MB per file.
- If upload is failing with less than 100MB files, try breaking down the files into smaller peices. We've seen this be necessary for some users will medium size files and poor to mediocre internet connects.

## Roadmap

- Long-term we would like this experience to feel like Google Drive where you can easily manage files.
