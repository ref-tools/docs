## Upload Flow

1. Go to `Resources > PDF & Markdown`.
2. Drag files or browse to select them.
3. Watch the progress meter for each upload.

## Processing Rules

- PDFs convert to markdown before indexing.
- Markdown keeps headings to preserve semantic search.
- Files larger than 50 MB should be split before upload.

## Versioning

- Re-uploading a file replaces the previous index.
- Job history keeps timestamps for audit trails.
- Delete a file to reclaim storage and prevent matches.

## Access Control

- Uploaded files follow the same team RBAC defaults.
- Readers can search results.
- Writers and admins can add and remove files.
