## Create a Team

1. Open the `Add members` card or visit `/create-team`.
2. Name the team and choose the billing owner.
3. Confirm the plan tier and invite the first members.

## Invites

- Pending invites appear on the dashboard with accept and decline buttons.
- Invited users get email plus in-app notifications.
- Resend invites from the team management table when needed.

## Shared Credits

- Teams pool credit purchases across members.
- Add-ons purchased in the portal appear in the team ledger.
- Usage charts show per-member consumption and endpoint mix.

## Lifecycle

- Leave a team from the member menu without affecting others.
- Delete a team only after typing the confirmation phrase.
- Deleting cancels subscriptions and removes shared data immediately.
