## Roles

| Role | Capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| Admin | Search resources, add content, invite members, manage billing |
| Writer | Search resources and add to the index |
| Reader | Search team resources only |

## Assignments

- Change roles from the team table dropdown.
- Updates apply instantly and audit logs capture the change.
- Invitations inherit the role defined during invite creation.

## Safety Nets

- Only admins can delete teams or buy credits.
- Writers cannot change billing or remove admins.
- Readers cannot upload new files or repos.
