## Data Protection

### Encryption Standards

Your data is protected using enterprise-grade encryption:

- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for stored documentation
- **Key Management**: Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for key storage
- **Database**: Encrypted database storage with regular key rotation

### Data Isolation

Each account and team maintains strict data isolation:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Account Separation">
    Individual accounts cannot access each other's data or search indices
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Team Boundaries">
    Team data is completely isolated from other teams and individual accounts
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Multi-Tenant Architecture">
    Secure multi-tenant design prevents data leakage between customers
