### Team Administration

#### Inviting Members

Invite new team members via email:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://ref.tools/api/teams/{team_id}/invite \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "colleague@company.com",
    "role": "member"
  }'
```

```javascript Dashboard
// Via the web dashboard
1. Go to Team Settings
2. Click "Invite Member"
3. Enter email and select role
4. Send invitation
```

</CodeGroup>

#### Managing Roles

Update member roles and permissions:

- **Promote members** to admin or owner roles
- **Adjust permissions** for specific documentation sources
- **Remove members** who no longer need access
- **Transfer ownership** when team leadership changes

### Team Indexing

Teams can index private and custom documentation sources:

#### Private GitHub Repositories

Index private repositories for team-specific code documentation:

```bash
# Index a private GitHub repository
curl -X POST https://ref.tools/api/teams/{team_id}/index \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "github",
    "url": "https://github.com/your-org/private-repo",
    "auth": {
      "token": "github_token_with_repo_access"
    }
  }'
```

#### Internal Documentation Sites

Add internal wikis, Confluence, or custom documentation:

```bash
# Index internal documentation
curl -X POST https://ref.tools/api/teams/{team_id}/index \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "web",
    "url": "https://internal-docs.company.com",
    "auth": {
      "type": "basic",
      "username": "user",
      "password": "pass"
    }
  }'
```
