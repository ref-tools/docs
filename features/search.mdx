## Search Types

### Documentation Search

Search through indexed documentation using natural language queries.

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://ref.tools/api/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "React component lifecycle methods"
  }'
```

```javascript MCP Tools
ref_search_documentation("React component lifecycle methods")
```

```python Python SDK
import ref_tools

client = ref_tools.Client("YOUR_API_KEY")
results = client.search_documentation("React component lifecycle methods")
```

</CodeGroup>

**Response:**
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "title": "React Component Lifecycle",
      "url": "https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#lifecycle",
      "excerpt": "Every component goes through several phases: mounting, updating, and unmounting...",
      "score": 0.92
    }
  ]
}
```

### Web Search

Access real-time information from across the web.

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://ref.tools/api/web-search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "latest Next.js 15 features"
  }'
```

```javascript MCP Tools
ref_search_web("latest Next.js 15 features")
```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
Web search costs 2 credits per query compared to 1 credit for documentation search.
</Warning>

### URL Reading

Extract and process content from specific URLs.

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://ref.tools/api/read-url \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/README.md"
  }'
```

```javascript MCP Tools
ref_read_url("https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/README.md")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Search Features

### Semantic Understanding

Ref uses advanced language models to understand the intent behind your queries:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Contextual Search">
    **Query:** "How to handle user input validation"
    
    **Understanding:** Searches for form validation, input sanitization, and security best practices across multiple frameworks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Code Examples">
    **Query:** "async/await error handling patterns"
    
    **Understanding:** Finds practical examples of try/catch blocks, Promise rejection handling, and async error patterns.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Conceptual Queries">
    **Query:** "database connection pooling benefits"
    
    **Understanding:** Retrieves explanations of connection pooling, performance benefits, and implementation strategies.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Smart Filtering

Ref automatically filters and ranks results based on:

- **Relevance Score**: How well content matches your query
- **Recency**: Preference for up-to-date information
- **Authority**: Weight given to official documentation
- **Context**: Understanding of your development environment

### Multi-Source Results

Search across multiple documentation sources simultaneously:

- **Official Documentation**: React, Vue, Angular, Node.js, etc.
- **API References**: REST APIs, GraphQL schemas, SDK documentation
- **Tutorials & Guides**: Step-by-step implementations and examples
- **Community Resources**: Stack Overflow, GitHub discussions, blogs

## Advanced Search Techniques

### Query Optimization

<Tip>
Use specific terms and context to get better results:
- ❌ "components"
- ✅ "React functional components with hooks"
</Tip>

### Search Operators

While Ref uses natural language processing, you can still use specific terms:

```
"Next.js API routes" middleware authentication
```

### Framework-Specific Searches

Include framework names for targeted results:

```
Vue 3 composition API reactive data
```

```
Django ORM complex queries joins
```

## Search Analytics

Monitor your search usage and effectiveness:

### Usage Metrics

- **Daily/Monthly Queries**: Track your search volume
- **Credit Consumption**: Monitor costs across search types
- **Response Times**: See average query performance
- **Result Quality**: Success rates and relevance scores

### Query History

Access your recent searches:

- Review past queries and results
- Re-run previous searches
- Share useful queries with your team
- Build query templates for common searches

## Integration Examples

### VS Code Extension

```json
{
  "ref.search.hotkey": "Ctrl+Shift+R",
  "ref.search.contextual": true,
  "ref.search.autoComplete": true
}
```

### Claude Desktop

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ref": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@ref-tools/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "REF_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor Integration

Use the built-in Cursor integration for seamless documentation access while coding.

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Query Construction">
    - Be specific with your questions
    - Include relevant context
    - Use technical terms appropriately
    - Ask complete questions
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Result Evaluation">
    - Check result relevance scores
    - Verify information currency
    - Cross-reference multiple sources
    - Save useful results for later
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No Results Found">
    - Try broader search terms
    - Check for typos in your query
    - Verify the documentation is indexed
    - Use web search for recent topics
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Irrelevant Results">
    - Add more specific context
    - Include framework or library names
    - Use more technical terminology
    - Filter by documentation source
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Slow Response Times">
    - Check your internet connection
    - Verify API key is valid
    - Monitor service status
    - Contact support for persistent issues
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
